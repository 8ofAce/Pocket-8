    description: "Do you remember the very first Grand Theft Auto? That old-school, top-down chaos. Think of that and give it a fresh coat of chunky 3D graphics. Next, drop that straight in your browser. Yes, it's Escape Car, a free online GTA game where you bolt through a mini-city, dodge police cars, tanks, helicopters and scoop up stacks of cash. Every tight drift, every split-second fake-out, and every totaled police cruiser bumps your score higher. Hang on long enough, and you’ll leave with pockets full of upgrade money and a grin wider than the avenue.",
